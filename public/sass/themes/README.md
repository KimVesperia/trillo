# themes

On large sites and applications, it is not unusual to have different themes. There are certainly different ways of dealing with themes but I personally like having them all in a themes/ folder.

Note â€” This is very project-specific and is likely to be non-existent on many projects.

Themes is used whenever a site has multiple themes. For instance, if a site has a admin and a user page. We can therefore assume this site is styled entirely differently for logged-in admins. Perhaps to better present and accommodate the additional features an Admin has. Some websites also offer a "night mode", where the background of the site is darker with lighter-colored text for easier reading in low-light environments. An option like this would be represented in its own theme file too.
